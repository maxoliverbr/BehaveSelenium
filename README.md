# Behave + Selenium Project

## Overview

This project combines Behave, a popular behavior-driven development (BDD) framework, with Selenium, a powerful web testing tool, to automate and test web applications. By using Behave's natural language Gherkin syntax and Selenium's capabilities for interacting with web elements, this project provides a robust framework for writing and executing automated tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Chrome or Firefox browser (depending on your WebDriver choice)
- ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver (WebDriver for Chrome or Firefox)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the appropriate WebDriver (ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Behave project structure:

- **features:** Contains Gherkin feature files that describe test scenarios.
- **step_definitions:** Defines step implementations corresponding to the Gherkin steps.
- **pages:** Includes Page Object Model (POM) classes representing web pages and their elements.
- **config:** Configuration files for WebDriver setup, environment variables, etc.
- **reports:** Generated test reports after test execution.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the project dependencies.

## Writing Tests

Write your test scenarios in Gherkin syntax in the `features` directory. Create corresponding step implementations in the `step_definitions` directory.

Example feature file (`features/sample.feature`):

```gherkin
Feature: Login functionality

  Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid username and password
    Then the user should be logged in successfully
